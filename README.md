# Principal_Component_Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is a most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models. Moreover, PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.
